## My Inspiration 
After graduating from Physical Education and Sports Teaching, I worked as a teacher for 2 years, followed by a year of experience as an academician at the university. Following my passion, I decided to transition into software development and enrolled in Computer Programming. Subsequently, feeling the need for more, I participated in the piscine boot camp at 42 Heilbronn school in Germany and succeeded. Currently, I am a student here, working on various projects.
I am eager to be part of the technology landscape, seizing opportunities in the present and future advancements. I am highly open to learning and believe that given the chance, I will thrive in this field.
